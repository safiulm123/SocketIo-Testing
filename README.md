# SocketIo-Testing
This is just a plain SocketIo Testing that I did to get understanding of the library

## Procedure for Testing
Run the server first before anything else by running the command as follows

	#cd Server && npm start
	
Once the server has started go into any of the clients and run npm start as well

	> cd ../Client1 && npm start

Once done you can see the console logs for results.
